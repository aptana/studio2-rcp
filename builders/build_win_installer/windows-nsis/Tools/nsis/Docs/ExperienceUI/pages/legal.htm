	    The first person I would like to thank for this whole thing is Amir Szekely, aka KiCHiK.  He's done so much awesome work on NSIS,
	    he's always got a great idea for a new feature, and, heck, he can code like crazy!<br>
	    <br>
	    I also want to thank Joost Verburg for writing the Modern UI, which is where I got the section descriptions, multi-language
	    support, and lots of NSIS knowledge.<br>
	    <br>
	    Of course, I want to say thanks to ZmAn3, who created the computer graphic (Left Logo) that is used by default in all ExperienceUI
	    installers.<br>
	    <br>
	    Next on the list is MacroVision, for the inspiration to make this thing.  They've always got great ideas for us third-party
	    imitators to copy.  InstallShield® might be slow, but if it didn't look so good, this text would probably be buried somewhere
	    in the Modern UI readme right now.<br>
	    <br>
	    Finally, hats off to Afrow UK for hosting the download site until I could get something going.<br>

	  <font face=Verdana style=font-size:8pt color=#000000>
	  I used the following software to create the ExperienceUI:<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://nsis.sourceforge.net')">NSIS</a></b> - Oh, NSIS where would we be without you? Probably using Inno Setup or InstallShield and wishing for a more flexible/faster
	  scripting platform.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://hmne.sourceforge.net')">HM NIS Edit</a></b> - The best NSIS editor on the planet, hands down.  HMNE is great for beginners and advanced programmers alike,
	  and it has an integrated compiler.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://www.jedit.org')">jEdit 4.2</a></b> - I used jEdit to create the page you're reading right now, and I would recommend it to any programmer that needs
	  an editor with support for lots of languages.  jEdit saves open files, markers, and even caret positions when you close it, so
	  you'll never be looking for where you left off again.  Make sure you have Java.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://www.knopper.net/knoppix')">KNOPPIX Linux</a></b> - I was on vacation and needed a laptop to keep up with my work, but the only one available didn't have a hard disk (go figure).  I simply popped my KNOPPIX LiveCD into the laptop and loaded my config from my USB pen drive, and I was good to go!  The download is 700MB, so make sure you have at least DSL, and preferably T1.  Oh, yeah, you can also buy a CD.  Like most Linux distros, you can't write to NTFS very well, so try to have a FAT or FAT32 partition to store shared files on.  I used the Kate editor to hand-modify this readme.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://www.aha-soft.com')">IconLover</a></b> - IconLover might be intended for use as an icon editor, but it's soooooo powerful...if you need an alternative
	  to Paint (who doesn't?) this should be your first stop.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://www.gimp.org')">The GIMP</a></b> - If you haven't heard of this open-source alternative to Photoshop, you must be extremely new to the Internet.  I used the GIMP to create some of the more impressive images in the ExperienceUI.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://sourceforge.net')">SourceForge.net</a></b> - "Everybody loves SourceForge" is the best thing since Linux.  They'll host your open-source projects for absolutely free (open source coding doesn't exactly pay too well), and SourceForge provides you with all the admin tools you could possibly want.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b><a href="javascript:loadBrowser('http://www.opencube.com')">OpenCube Tree Menus</a></b> - The menu tree on the left of the window was based on code by OpenCube.<br>
