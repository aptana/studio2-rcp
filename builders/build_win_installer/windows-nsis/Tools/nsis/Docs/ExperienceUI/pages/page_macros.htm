	    <b>A note on page defines:</b> When you define a custom string, it is usually applied to the installer only.  To make a custom string that applies to the uninstaller, define the string as normal, but add UN after the XPUI_ part of the define.  An example would be XPUI_COMPONENTSPAGE_TITLE becomes XPUI_<b>UN</b>COMPONENTSPAGE_TITLE.  Note that this does not apply to macros; to insert, for example, the welcome page into your uninstaller, insert XPUI_PAGEMODE_UNINST and then XPUI_PAGE_WELCOME.</m2><br>
