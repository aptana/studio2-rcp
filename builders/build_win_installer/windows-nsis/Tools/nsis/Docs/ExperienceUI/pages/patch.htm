              Like all computer programs, the ExperienceUI has its bugs.  Since version 1.02, however, the ExperienceUI has included a patching
              system that can update any file that is related to the ExperienceUI or any NSIS component.  The patch files are simply ZIP archives
              with a special file, CONTENT.DAT, that tells where everything goes.  This method of distributing updates allows for very small files;
              files that do not require a setup program, just a shell extension in the Registry.  The patching system also allows installation of
              new components, such as extra features or skins.  There is even a separate format made just for skins!<br>
              <br>
              Installing a patch or skin is very easy.  All you have to do is click on the file in Windows Explorer, and the installer handles the rest.
              You can also write your own patches or skins.  See the next section for more information.

          <h1>Writing patch files</h1>
          
            <p style=margin-left:0.2in><font face=Verdana style=font-size:8pt color=#000000>
              Writing an ExperienceUI patch or skin is very simple.  If you have WinZip® or even Windows 98/ME/XP's integrated ZIP features and a
              basic text editor, you have the tools required to build a patch or skin for the ExperienceUI. Here's how:<br>
              <br>
              <ol type=1>
                <li><b>Gather up your files.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Make a new ZIP file, and put all of the files you want to install into the archive's root directory.<br><br></li>
                <li><b>Create a CONTENT.DAT information file.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Create a new text file, call it CONTENT.DAT, and open it in Notepad, WordPad, emacs, or any other text editor.<br><br></li>
                <li><b>List your patch's files.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Type [EUI-Patch] or [EUI-Skin] (including the brackets) at the top of your file.  Hit enter.<br><br>
                    Now type <b>NumFiles=#</b> and replace # with the number of files in your patch, <b>not</b> including CONTENT.DAT.<br><br>
                    Make a few more new lines, and then type <b>File1=&lt;filename&gt;</b> and replace &lt;filename&gt; with the first file
                    in your patch/skin.  Hit Enter.<br><br>
                    Type in <b>File1 Path=MyPath</b> for the folder to extract the file to.  If you are extracting the file to the ExperienceUI's
                    installation root directory, create this field, but leave it blank.  Hit Enter one more time.<br>
                    If you're writing a patch, type <b>File1 Desc=My Description String</b> and replace My Description String with a description
                    of the file.  This key does not apply to skins.<br><br>
                    Now, add one more <b>File1</b>/<b>File1 Path</b>/<b>File1 Desc</b> section to the install script file (aka CONTENT.DAT) for
                    each file in your patch/skin, each time replacing the 1 with a number one higher than the previous file entry.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you're done, the file should look somewhat like this:<br>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                    [EUI-Patch]<br>
                    NumFiles=3<br>
                    <br>
                    File1=XPUI.NSH<br>
                    File1 Path=<br>
                    File1 Desc=ExperienceUI main script<br>
                    <br>
                    File2=English.NSH<br>
                    File2 Path=Language Files<br>
                    File2 Desc=English Language string table<br>
                    <br>
                    File3=Plus.bmp<br>
                    File3 Path=Readme\Images<br>
                    File3 Desc=Documentation section expand button, mouse out<br><br>
                    </code></li>
                    
                    <li><b>Add the CONTENT.DAT file to your ZIP archive.</b><br>
                        <br>
                        This next step should be a little easier.  Fire up your zip utility, and
                        add the CONTENT.DAT file you just created to the ZIP file.<br><br></li>
                        
                    <li><b>Rename the file.</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Open up Command Prompt, usually done by going to Start &gt; Run, typing CMD, and pressing Enter, and change to the
                        directory where your ZIP file is.  Type in the command <b>REN &lt;file&gt;.zip
                        &lt;file&gt;.eup</b> for a patch or <b>REN &lt;file&gt;.zip &lt;file&gt;.eus</b> for a skin.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>That's it! To test your skin/patch, just double-click it.  After testing it, you'll be ready to distribute it over
                        the Web.
              </ol>
